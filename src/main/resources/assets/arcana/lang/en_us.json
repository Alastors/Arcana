    "research.arcana.root.stage.1": "There is more than meets the eye when it comes to this wand. By tapping it against a bookshelf, I have created a magical book, capable of storing large amounts of knowledge - especially magical knowledge. Information is organised into entries, such as the one I'm reading right now, which can have multiple stages. To complete a stage, I must fulfill its requirements, shown just below the book itself. Once I have everything I need, I can move onto the next stage. Some requirements will require me to use up resources, such as experience levels or items, while others simply require me to do tasks or have items present.\\n\\nThere seems to be more to this book than that; I'll require some further investigation.",
    "research.arcana.root.stage.2": "After some further observation, I have found that the knowledge written in this book is bound to me, somehow; any copy of this book will present the same set of information, regardless of who made it or previously used it; and any knowledge I write will also persist after death.\\n\\nFinally, the book seems to have a kind of subtle intelligence of its own, trying to guide me into further more advanced and interesting magic. This is exciting! I can't wait to see what kind of inventions await me.",

    "research.arcana.revealing.desc": "Now you see me, now you don't",
    "research.arcana.revealing.stage.1": "Although this wand is somewhat magical on its own, it does seem to have the capacity to do so much more, if I could use it correctly. My experience using it has taught me something vital about the world: energy is all around me. Energy that can't be seen or felt directly - at least, not at its usual concentration. I have dubbed this energy *vis*, and need to find a proper source of it to do anything more powerful than creating fancy books. Scattered around the world are glowing points in space, which seem to have a higher-than-average concentration of vis. I have designed a set of goggles with which I can view vis, and nodes too, directly.",

Teaching them everything manually is irritating and time-consuming. Perhaps a modified version of this book could teach them instead?",
    "research.arcana.tome_of_sharing.stage.2": "By combining this book with an eye of ender, I can link it to my knowledge specifically, taking advantage of what seems to be similar to the mechanism behind ender chests. Anyone else reading it will gain access to my knowledge.",

    "research.arcana.vis_manipulators.stage.1": "All living things seem to weakly interact with vis in some way, including myself. I intend to take advantage of vis for my own purposes, but to do so, I'll need to figure out how I can manipulate it peroperly and consistently.",
    "research.arcana.vis_manipulators.stage.2": "Certain materials seem to interact with it in interesting ways. Glass can manipulate it similarly to light, albiet in a more convoluted way; redstone can act as a kind of semiconductor; diamond can concentrate and store it, although I have no way to know how much, yet. Lapis is a kind of fossil fuel for it, capable of releasing a large amount of it (could this be related to enchantment?). Gold, then, is like a superconductor, freely transmitting vis. Finally, iron is resistant to it, absorbing large amounts before showing obserable differences. Wood is a simple, primitive, but abundant vis storage material.\\n\\nMy next task will be creating a tool based on these concepts to properly control vis.",
    "research.arcana.vis_manipulators.stage.3": "The §oVis Manipulation Tools§r are built on the the abilities of diamond, redstone, and glass. With them, I can transfer vis between items capable of containing it - currently just wands - and combine aspects into their compound aspects - that is, if I had anything capable of storing compound aspects. I expect more applications for their use fill appear soon.",

I can do this by completing research, and testing various theories that I might have. The applications of simply using up resources or tinkering with mundane items is limited, however. I need to come up with a dedicated research workspace for more complex work and theories. One possibility for this is a specially-equipped table, providing scribing and vis-handling capabilities, as well as a nice, focused environment.",
    "research.arcana.research_intro.stage.2": "The use of the §oresearch table§r allows me to complete more difficult research puzzles, each of which has its own rules and is most tailored to certain applications. The table has the ability to store vis, and draw vis from other objects that can store vis.\\n\\nTo use the table, I first need a research note for the entry I want to work on, which can be obtained by clicking on the relevant puzzle requirement with paper and scribing tools in my inventory. Then, I simply place it with scribing tools into the table, and play the game. I can then right click with a complete research note to mark the puzzle as complete.",

    "research.arcana.tainted.stage.1": "Taint, in its natural state, is unwieldy and unusable, corrupting all in its path and twisting them into husks of their former selves. Despite my best efforts to contain it, its spread seems inevitable at times, with only diligent cleanup and harsh work keeping it in check. Perhaps there's a better way -- perhaps I can instead tame the beast, and put it to my own uses.\\n\\nTo that end, I have created the §otainted codex§r: a safe store for my research, to contain whatever revelations or ramblings I create.\\n\\nThe first obvious usage of taint is in spellcasting; specifically, using it as part of a wand. I will need to test how a tainted component affects its spellcasting and vis storage capabilities."
